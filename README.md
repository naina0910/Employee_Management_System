view a list of all employees, add new employees, update existing employee details, and 
delete employee records. This ensures that administrators can maintain accurate and 
up-to-date employee information across the organization.

own details and download their payslip in PDF format. This provides employees with 
a simple and secure way to manage and access their personal information.

that each user has access to the appropriate features according to their role. This role-based 
structure ensures that sensitive data is protected and only accessible to authorized users.
